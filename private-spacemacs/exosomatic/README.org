* Anatomy of a layer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: anatomy-of-a-layer
:END:
A layer is simply a folder somewhere in Spacemacs' layer search path that
usually contains these files (listed in loading order).

- =layers.el= :: declare additional layers
- =packages.el= :: the packages list and configuration
- =funcs.el= :: all functions used in the layer should be declared here
- =config.el= :: layer specific configuration
- =keybindings.el= :: general key bindings

Additionally, for each local package (see the next section), there should be a
folder =<layer>/local/<package>/= containing the source code for that package.
Before initializing that package, Spacemacs will add this folder to the load
path for you.
